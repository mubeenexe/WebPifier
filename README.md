# WebPifier

WebPifier is a modern image conversion tool built with Next.js, designed to streamline the process of converting images to and from the WebP format.

## Core Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Upload:** Easily drag and drop image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG, or WebP) into the designated area for quick uploads.
- **Original Image Preview:** Instantly preview the original uploaded image before conversion.
- **Conversion Direction Toggle:** Select the conversion direction (to WebP or from WebP) with a simple toggle switch.
- **Submit Button:** Convert your image with a single click, triggering backend processing.
- **Automatic Download:** The converted image is automatically downloaded to your device, with an option to provide a download link.
- **Converted Image Preview:** View a preview of the image after it has been converted.
- **Animated UI:** The app uses framer-motion for smooth entrance animations on the hero section, feature cards, and other key UI elements. The Get Started button scrolls smoothly to the converter section for a modern, interactive experience.

- **Font:** 'Inter', a modern, neutral, and highly readable sans-serif font for body and headlines.
- **Layout:** Clear visual hierarchy, optimized for both desktop and mobile views for ease of use across devices.
